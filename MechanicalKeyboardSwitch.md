# Mechanical Keyboard Switch
**Class: Advanced Engineering Design Graphics**
**UC Berkeley** | *August 2023 - December 2023*

## Overview
In this course, our team was tasked with reverse engineering, modeling, and animating a mechanical device. The two of us decided to focus on a **mechanical keyboard**. The keyboard was split into 6 main components: the switch, case, stabilizers, keycaps, PCB, and plate.

## Key Contributions
Lead a team of two to meet project goals within a given deadline. Designated tasks to each member with considerations to knowledge of keyboards, experience with programs (Creo, 3ds Max), and availability with respect to other class work. I was responsible for modeling the mechanical switch, keycaps, and PCB.

### Mechanical Keyboard Switch
The mechanical switch is made up of 6 parts including the bottom and top housing, stem, metal leaf (2 parts), and the spring. The top/bottom housing, stem, and metal leaf were all measured by hand and modeled in **Creo** while the spring was modeled in **3ds Max**.

### Animation
I hand animated the mechanical switch showing how the mechanism completes a circuit when pressed. I also animated how the entire keyboard is assembled with a real typing test demonstration.

## Final Models
### Switch (Creo)
