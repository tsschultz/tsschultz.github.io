# Automatic Koi Fish Feeder
**Class: Intro to Product Development**
**UC Berkeley** | *January 2023 - May 2023*

## Overview
Our team was tasked with developing a product to address a specific problem or need. This process involved contacting potential customers, researching competing products, and manufacturing a working prototype.

## Key Contributions
In this project I took on a project management and design role. I decided on an auger mechanism for dispensing food due to its simplicity, reliability, and consistency. This alleviated the need for designing a portioning system and allowing quick fixes with fewer components. I helped with designing the mounting system where the feeder can either be placed on the ground or hung up above a pond as well as the developing a customization solution.

### Key Features and Design Elements
- **Customizable:** I designed the four walls of the feeder with slots to hold interchangeable plates. This system supports any material plate and design to help the feeder blend in or stand out in any koi pond.

- **Thermocouple:** This sensor was a necessary choice because koi fish metabolism drastically slows below 10 degrees Celsius, allowing harmful bacteria to grow in their digestive tract when fed. This inclusion also allows the koi feeder full autonomy without customer input beyond reloading food.

- **Programmable:** Using Python, we programmed three controls for users; feeding time, food output, and allowed feeding temperature. These measures give customers full control over their feeder and koi pond needs. These factors help account for any size pond and number of fish.

### Final Product
