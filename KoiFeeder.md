# Automatic Koi Fish Feeder
**Class: Intro to Product Development**
**UC Berkeley** | *January 2023 - May 2023*

## Overview
Our team was tasked with addressing a need, not a solution,... design a product and develope the basis for a company. This included analyzing competing products, reviewing patents, intterating and improving upon known solutions, surveying potential customers, and present our final product.

Research and development, conceptualization and design, prototyping, production and launch

## Key Contributions
In this project I took on a project management role with allocating work based on each member's strenghts, overseeing communication with potential customers, and ensuring that we reach our timeline goals. I was greatly involved in the design process of our koi feeder as well as the final CAD model.

### Key Features and Desgin Elements
- **Customizable:** We designed the feeder to be easily customizable to tailor to our customers preferences. This allows for the feeder to blend in or stand out in any koi pond.
- **Thermocouple:** Koi fish metabolism drastically slows down in cold temperatures so it can be hamrful or even lethal if fed during cold seasons. The thermocouple is necessary for our design to account for cold temperatures ensurring that the koi are not accidentally fed.
- **Programmable:** Customers are able to input the time and amount of fed to their koi. This allows customers full control over their feeder and account for the size and number of fish in their pond.

### Final Product

## Skills
- **Software:** SolidWorks, MS Office
