# R&D Intern - PCB Design
**Genius Traffic System Co. Ltd (GeTS)**
**Bangkok, Thailand** | *May 2023 - July 2023*

---

## Overview
During the summer of 2023, I had the privilege of working at **Genius Traffic System Co. Ltd (GeTS)**, one of Thailand's top traffic technology companies. As a part of the Research and Development department, I was tasked with designing and reverse engineering **Printed Circuit Boards (PCBs)**. These PCBs were critical for updating old designs and saving costs by developing in house components. 

### PCB Projects
- **Traffic Light:** This project involved designing and importing a sketch from **Fusion 360** to **Atlium Designer** according specifications. From the sketch, I used the geometry to accurately organize the LED array.

The PCB was designed to support different colors with different placements of resistors. This placement determined whether the circuit was in series or in parallel. The series circuit supported yellow and red light while the parallel circuit supported green light. This allowed for a single traffic light PCB to support all necessary functions.

- **Surge Protector:** The company tasked me to reverse engineer an existing surge protector product used for their traffic lights and cameras. Designing and manufacturing our own component would save the company an estimated 80% on third-party products. This PCB required new footprints for a number of electric components which were added to the company's library for future use.

- **CPU Tester:** The CPU tester's function, as the name suggests, was for the company to check their machines were working properly. This was by far the most complicated design with a large number of different electical components and new footprints that needed to be made.
