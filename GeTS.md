## Overview
During the summer of 2023, I had the privilege of working at **Genius Traffic System Co. Ltd (GeTS)**, one of Thailand's top traffic technology companies. As a part of the **Research and Development** department, I was tasked with designing and reverse engineering **Printed Circuit Boards (PCBs)**. These PCBs were critical for updating old designs and saving costs by developing in house components. 

### PCB Projects
- **Traffic Light:** The PCB was designed to support different colors with the placement of a single resistor in one of two spots. In one spot, the circuit will be in series for green while the other spot puts the circuit in parallel for yellow and red.

- **Surge Protector:** The company provided me with an existing surge protector product used for their traffic lights and cameras to reverse engineer. Designing and manufacturing our own component would save the company an estimated 80% on third-party products. 

- **CPU Tester:**
